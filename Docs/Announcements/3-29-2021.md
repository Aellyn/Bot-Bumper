# **Bot Bumper is Back!**

Thanks so much for bearing with us during this time!  **We're back!**  We're proud to say that **no data was lost**, so you can continue bumping as usual!  We've also **reduced the cooldown to 30 minutes** for bumping and it will stay like this for quite a while to make up for the lost time!  We will also be adding and giving out some more perks too as a token of our appreciation! 

We're also going to be turning our attention towards **slash commands** for Bot Bumper, and we want to give you the best experience possible with that!  We will be revamping our current slash commands and experimenting with new things this week, so **be on the look-out for that!**

Thank you all so much for your continued patience!  **We love you guys!**
