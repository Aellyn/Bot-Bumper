# **Version 3.1**

Welcome to Version 3.1 of Bot Bumper.  We have some exciting new updates to announce!

**Slash Commands (for your advertisement):**
If your bot has slash commands, you can specify this when you setup your bot.  With slash commands, your bot will receive a special flair on it's advertisement when bumped indicating that it has slash commands.  The invite link will also have the `applications.commands` scope added to it (even if you don't have premium).  For existing bots on the system, there is a new option in the `edit` command (option `6`) that will allow you to enable or disable slash commands for your bot.  Please do not do this if your bot doesn't have slash commands.

**Database:**
Incase you missed our last announcement, we have fixed our database and everything is up and running!  As a thank you to everyone for being so patient, we have **reduced** the bump time to 30 minutes (that's half the time it was before)!  Thank you so much for bearing with us!

**Backend Fixes:**
We have been working on the backend of this bot and added some fixes to accommodate newer features coming soon and bringing our current libraries up to date.  We're also posting our server count to more bot lists.

That's it for this update!  Thanks so much for using Bot Bumper and have a great day!
