# Privacy Policy

##### Welcome to the official **Bot Bumper** privacy policy.

## Introduction

  
In this document, we will cover what data we collect from you and your server when you use this bot. Data collection is essential to the bot’s functionality and is also intended to help keep our systems, bot, and our users safe from bad actors. A near-complete if not complete list of data that we collect will be covered here and reasons for why we collect them. As some data mentioned are deemed to be quite sensitive, please know that only a select few bot administrators have access to said data and said data will only be used during extreme circumstances.

  

## Joining a Server

  

Upon joining your Discord server, the bot will collect your server’s public information to determine whether or not it's blacklisted, the server owner’s public information for upcoming premium server features. If we detect that your server is causing problems (such as consistently crashing the bot) or is deemed malicious, we will take action by initiating a small investigation which will determine if commands are being spammed, harmful actions are being performed against the bot, etc. In most cases, the server will be blacklisted and/or the bot may leave the server if we find anything malicious. We will not sift through your messages or internal private server data to determine this as we have an anti-spam system that recognizes if commands are being used in a short amount of time. Upon a blacklist, your server data is mostly removed (such as tag data) to save space on our system. If the bot leaves your server, all server data is automatically removed.

  

## Miscellaneous Server Data

  

Other server data we collect includes webhook URLs when the `bumpchannel` command for moderation logs are run as well as channel IDs for bot announcements (if subscribed). With the `bumpchannel` command, we store your webhook URL in our cache. If you remove our bot from your server, we automatically remove the webhook ID from cache, but we do not delete the webhook in your server. This essentially means that we do not have access to your webhook, but it will remain so you don’t have to re-run the setup command if you ever want to re-invite the bot.

  

## User Usage

  

When you use our bot (such as typing in a command), we collect data to determine if you are blacklisted or use stored database information to respond to your queries. For example, if you run the `bump` command, we will go through our database and respond with the bot you added. Other user data we gather would be data that is made publicly available to us by Discord. An example of how this data would be used would be in our `userinfo` command where you can search up any valid user on Discord.

  

## Data Collection Methods

  

Our data is stored in different ways and is stored for different amounts of time depending on the data stored. For example, your and server blacklist data would be stored until your account or the server gets deleted and your public Discord data we collect is dumped every month to allow for new data to come in. We dump our channel ID data every 3 months and automatically re-log channel ID data (for the announcement channel, bump channel, etc.) so you don’t notice any issues with functionality. The same goes with your webhook data (for webhooked logs, commands, etc.).

  

## Opting Out

  

We understand that you and/or your server may not be comfortable with this bot collecting data, so we introduced a new data-collection opt-out system. To run a data wipe for users, you can use the `removemybot` command.  This will remove everything associated to your bot.  If you are blacklisted or would like your server data removed, you can join our support server and request this in our support channel. After requesting, we will manually remove your data. Please note that server blacklist and user blacklist data will not be removed, but data we collect from you such as your bot advertisement, server-setup channel IDs, etc. will be removed. Please note that upon removing data, bot functionality may be limited due to settings reverted, etc.

  

## Conclusion

  

Once again, we would like to stress that very few staff members have access to your data. Only certified bot moderators and bot administrators as well as owners have access. We pick and choose our staff very thoroughly, so we trust them with the data that is being bestowed upon them. Once again, we understand if you don’t feel comfortable, so you are more than welcome to request a data removal.
