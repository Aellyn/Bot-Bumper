# Guidelines

## General
1. Bot's must follow Discord ToS and Guidelines\
2. You must submit your __own__ bot\
3. You must keep your description appropriate
4. Only require permissions you need for the bot invite link
5. Your bot submitted must be your own creation (cannot be a fork of another bot)
6. Fill out all fields correctly, and "troll" responses will not be accepted (submitting an official Discord bot such as `Clyde#0000` is considered a troll)
7. Your bot's description must be descriptive and accurately explain what your bot can do in detail
8. Moderators have the right to remove bots as they see fit
9. Invite links may not contain malware, direct you to sites that give the user money in exchange for ads (including but not limited to adf.ly, click.sh, etc.), or direct users to troll/prank websites.  They also may not direct users to another bot's website
10. Use common sense and your best judgement.  What would not be acceptable in your eyes would most likely not be acceptable here

## Bumping Rules
1. You may not use a self bot, macro, etc. to bump
2. You may not setup the same bot ad on an alt to bypass cooldowns
3. Circumventing cooldowns, restrictions, etc. are prohibited
4. Finding bumping exploits and abusing them are strictly prohibited.  Please report all exploits in our [support server](https://discord.gg/7va3rtC)

## Removals
Got your bot removed?  This bot will most likely send you a DM with the reason why your bot was removed (assuming you have DMs open).  If you believe that your bot was removed unfairly, please join our support server and tell us.  If you have any questions regarding this, please ask us in our support server.
